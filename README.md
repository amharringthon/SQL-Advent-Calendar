# SQL Christmas Calendar Challenge ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## Description
This repository contains my daily SQL solutions for the **SQL Christmas Calendar Challenge**, a 24-day challenge created by **Dawn Choo**. Each day presents a unique SQL problem designed to enhance skills in:
- Data exploration and analysis.
- Writing complex queries using joins, aggregations, and window functions.
- Problem-solving and optimization.

## Queries
- All query solutions are available in the `/queries` folder.
- Each `.sql` file corresponds to a specific day in the challenge.

## Detailed Explanations
For detailed explanations of each solution, including breakdowns and insights, visit my [Notion Portfolio](https://www.notion.so/SQL-Advent-Calendar-Challenge-160e124aeb798097bfd6c042c5b7bf3f). ðŸŒŸ

## How to Use
- The queries in this repository were designed to solve problems hosted on the [SQL Calendar platform](https://www.sqlcalendar.com/app/advent-calendar).
- Note: The datasets are hosted externally and are not included in this repository. Queries cannot be run directly without access to the data.
